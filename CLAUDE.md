# SimpleTimer - Development Guidelines

## Load Order (Global → Project)

Claude reads docs in this order. Later sources override earlier:

### 1. Global Framework (base conventions)
- `~/work/claude-framework/agent_docs/_index.md` - core docs
- `~/work/claude-framework/skills/` - reusable skills

### 2. Project Overrides (project-specific)
- `.claude/agent_docs/` - override/extend framework docs
- `.claude/skills/` - project-specific skills

**Override rule:** If file exists in both locations, project version wins.

# Laravel Boost Guidelines

The Laravel Boost guidelines are specifically curated by Laravel maintainers for this application. These guidelines should be followed closely to enhance the user's satisfaction building Laravel applications.

## Foundational Context
This application is a Laravel application and its main Laravel ecosystems package & versions are below. You are an expert with them all. Ensure you abide by these specific packages & versions.

- php - 8.4.17
- laravel/framework (LARAVEL) - v12
- laravel/prompts (PROMPTS) - v0
- larastan/larastan (LARASTAN) - v3
- laravel/mcp (MCP) - v0
- laravel/pint (PINT) - v1
- laravel/sail (SAIL) - v1
- phpunit/phpunit (PHPUNIT) - v12
- rector/rector (RECTOR) - v2

## Conventions
- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts
- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove it works. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture
- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling
- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Replies
- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

## Documentation Files
- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

=== boost rules ===

## Laravel Boost
- Laravel Boost is an MCP server that comes with powerful tools designed specifically for this application. Use them.

## Artisan
- Use the `list-artisan-commands` tool when you need to call an Artisan command to double-check the available parameters.

## URLs
- Whenever you share a project URL with the user, you should use the `get-absolute-url` tool to ensure you're using the correct scheme, domain/IP, and port.

## Tinker / Debugging
- You should use the `tinker` tool when you need to execute PHP to debug code or query Eloquent models directly.
- Use the `database-query` tool when you only need to read from the database.

## Reading Browser Logs With the `browser-logs` Tool
- You can read browser logs, errors, and exceptions using the `browser-logs` tool from Boost.
- Only recent browser logs will be useful - ignore old logs.

## Searching Documentation (Critically Important)
- Boost comes with a powerful `search-docs` tool you should use before any other approaches when dealing with Laravel or Laravel ecosystem packages. This tool automatically passes a list of installed packages and their versions to the remote Boost API, so it returns only version-specific documentation for the user's circumstance. You should pass an array of packages to filter on if you know you need docs for particular packages.
- The `search-docs` tool is perfect for all Laravel-related packages, including Laravel, Inertia, Livewire, Filament, Tailwind, Pest, Nova, Nightwatch, etc.
- You must use this tool to search for Laravel ecosystem documentation before falling back to other approaches.
- Search the documentation before making code changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.
- Use multiple, broad, simple, topic-based queries to start. For example: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`.
- Do not add package names to queries; package information is already shared. For example, use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Available Search Syntax
- You can and should pass multiple queries at once. The most relevant results will be returned first.

1. Simple Word Searches with auto-stemming - query=authentication - finds 'authenticate' and 'auth'.
2. Multiple Words (AND Logic) - query=rate limit - finds knowledge containing both "rate" AND "limit".
3. Quoted Phrases (Exact Position) - query="infinite scroll" - words must be adjacent and in that order.
4. Mixed Queries - query=middleware "rate limit" - "middleware" AND exact phrase "rate limit".
5. Multiple Queries - queries=["authentication", "middleware"] - ANY of these terms.

=== php rules ===

## PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even if it has one line.

### Constructors
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion in `__construct()`.
    - <code-snippet>public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }</code-snippet>
- Do not allow empty `__construct()` methods with zero parameters unless the constructor is private.

### Type Declarations
- Always use explicit return type declarations for methods and functions.
- Use appropriate PHP type hints for method parameters.

<code-snippet name="Explicit Return Types and Method Params" lang="php">
protected function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool
{
    ...
}
</code-snippet>

## Comments
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Never use comments within the code itself unless there is something very complex going on.

## PHPDoc Blocks
- Add useful array shape type definitions for arrays when appropriate.

## Enums
- Typically, keys in an Enum should be TitleCase. For example: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.

=== tests rules ===

## Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test --compact` with a specific filename or filter.

=== laravel/core rules ===

## Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using the `list-artisan-commands` tool.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Database
- Always use proper Eloquent relationship methods with return type hints. Prefer relationship methods over raw queries or manual joins.
- Use Eloquent models and relationships before suggesting raw database queries.
- Avoid `DB::`; prefer `Model::query()`. Generate code that leverages Laravel's ORM capabilities rather than bypassing them.
- Generate code that prevents N+1 query problems by using eager loading.
- Use Laravel's query builder for very complex database operations.

### Model Creation
- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `list-artisan-commands` to check the available options to `php artisan make:model`.

### APIs & Eloquent Resources
- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

### Controllers & Validation
- Always create Form Request classes for validation rather than inline validation in controllers. Include both validation rules and custom error messages.
- Check sibling Form Requests to see if the application uses array or string based validation rules.

### Queues
- Use queued jobs for time-consuming operations with the `ShouldQueue` interface.

### Authentication & Authorization
- Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features (gates, policies, Sanctum, etc.).

### URL Generation
- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

### Configuration
- Use environment variables only in configuration files - never use the `env()` function directly outside of config files. Always use `config('app.name')`, not `env('APP_NAME')`.

### Testing
- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

### Vite Error
- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== laravel/v12 rules ===

## Laravel 12

- Use the `search-docs` tool to get version-specific documentation.
- Since Laravel 11, Laravel has a new streamlined file structure which this project uses.

### Laravel 12 Structure
- In Laravel 12, middleware are no longer registered in `app/Http/Kernel.php`.
- Middleware are configured declaratively in `bootstrap/app.php` using `Application::configure()->withMiddleware()`.
- `bootstrap/app.php` is the file to register middleware, exceptions, and routing files.
- `bootstrap/providers.php` contains application specific service providers.
- The `app\Console\Kernel.php` file no longer exists; use `bootstrap/app.php` or `routes/console.php` for console configuration.
- Console commands in `app/Console/Commands/` are automatically available and do not require manual registration.

### Database
- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.
- Laravel 12 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models
- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.

=== pint/core rules ===

## Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- You must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint` to fix any formatting issues.

=== phpunit/core rules ===

## PHPUnit

- This application uses PHPUnit for testing. All tests must be written as PHPUnit classes. Use `php artisan make:test --phpunit {name}` to create a new test.
- If you see a test using "Pest", convert it to PHPUnit.
- Every time a test has been updated, run that singular test.
- When the tests relating to your feature are passing, ask the user if they would like to also run the entire test suite to make sure everything is still passing.
- Tests should test all of the happy paths, failure paths, and weird paths.
- You must not remove any tests or test files from the tests directory without approval. These are not temporary or helper files; these are core to the application.

### Running Tests
- Run the minimal number of tests, using an appropriate filter, before finalizing.
- To run all tests: `php artisan test --compact`.
- To run all tests in a file: `php artisan test --compact tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php`.
- To filter on a particular test name: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName` (recommended after making a change to a related file).

=== hotwired-laravel/turbo-laravel rules ===

## Hotwire/Turbo Core Principles
- For standard application development, use Hotwire (Turbo + Stimulus)
- For most interactions, use regular links and form submits (Turbo Drive will make them fast and dynamic)
- Decompose pages with Turbo Frames for independent sections that update separately
- Use Turbo Streams for real-time updates and dynamic content changes
- Leverage Stimulus for progressive JavaScript enhancement when Turbo isn't sufficient (if Stimulus is available)
- Prefer server-side template rendering and state management over client-side frameworks and state
- Use data attributes for JavaScript hooks and CSS styling for as much as possible

## Base Helpers

- Turbo automatically handles page navigation, form submissions, and CSRF protection
- You may configure morphing and scroll preservation for a page (or layout) with: `<x-turbo::refreshes-with method="morph" scroll="preserve" />`
- Generate unique DOM IDs from models: use the `dom_id($model, 'optional_prefix')` global function or Blade directive `@domid($model, 'optional_prefix')`
- Generate CSS classes from models: use the `dom_class($model, 'optional_prefix')` global function or Blade directive `@domclass($model, 'optional_prefix')`

## Turbo Frames Best Practices
- Use frames to decompose pages into independent sections that can update without full page reloads
- Forms and links inside frames automatically target their containing frame (no configuration needed)
- You may override the default frame target of a link or form with `[data-turbo-frame]` attribute:
  - Use a frame's DOM ID to target a specific frame
  - Use the value `_top` to break out of frames and navigate the full page
- The `[:id]` prop accepts models and automatically generates DOM IDs for them
- The `[:src]` prop accepts a URL to lazy-load from content. Optionally, you may pair it with a `[loading=lazy]` so it only loads when the element is visible in the viewport

Example:

    ```blade
    <x-turbo::frame :id="$post">
        <h3>{{ $post->title }}</h3>
        <p>{{ $post->content }}</p>
        <a href="{{ route('posts.edit', $post) }}" data-turbo-frame="_top">Edit</a>
        <form action="{{ route('posts.store') }}" method="POST">
            @csrf
            <input type="text" name="title" required>
            <button type="submit">Create Post</button>
        </form>
    </x-turbo::frame>
    ```

## Turbo Streams for Dynamic Updates

- You may return Turbo Streams from controllers after form submissions to update specific page elements (always check if the request accepts Turbo Streams for resilience)

<code-snippet name="Controller returning Turbo Streams" lang="php">
    public function store(Request $request)
    {
        $post = Post::create($request->validated());

        if ($request->wantsTurboStream()) {
            return turbo_stream([
                turbo_stream()->append('posts', view('posts.partials.post', ['post' => $post])),
                turbo_stream()->update('create_post', view('posts.partials.form', ['post' => new Post()])),
                // turbo_stream()->prepend('some_dom_id', view('posts.partials.post', ['post' => $post])),
                // turbo_stream()->before('some_dom_id', view('...'))
                // turbo_stream()->after('some_dom_id', view('...'))
                // turbo_stream()->replace('some_dom_id', view('...'))
                // turbo_stream()->remove('some_dom_id')
            ]);
        }

        return back();
    }
</code-snippet>

- Turbo Streams can also be broadcasted using Laravel Echo for real-time updates to all users connected to a channel:

<code-snippet name="Listening to Broadcasts" lang="blade">
    <x-turbo::stream-from :source="$post" />
</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Broadcasting Turbo Streams" lang="php">
    // Ensure the channel is defined in `routes/channels.php`:
    Broadcast::channel(Post::class, function (User $user, Post $post) {
        return $user->belongsToProject($post->project);
    });

    // Add the trait to the model:
    use HotwiredLaravel\TurboLaravel\Models\Broadcasts;

    class Post extends Model
    {
        use Broadcasts;
    }

    // When you want to trigger the broadcasting from anywhere (including model events)...
    $post->broadcastUpdate();
    $post->broadcastRemove();
    $post->broadcastAppend()->to('posts');
</code-snippet>

## Form Handling & Validation
- Use Laravel's resource route naming conventions for automatic form re-rendering, if the matching route exists:
  - `*.store` action redirects to `*.create` route (shows form again with validation errors)
  - `*.update` action redirects to `*.edit` route (shows form again with validation errors)
  - `*.destroy` action redirects to `*.delete` route
- Validation errors are automatically displayed when using this convention with Turbo

## Performance & UX Enhancements
- Use `data-turbo-permanent` to preserve specific elements during Turbo navigation (prevents re-rendering):

    ```blade
    <div id="flash-messages" data-turbo-permanent>
        <!-- Flash messages that persist across navigation -->
    </div>
    ```

- Preloading is automatically enabled on all links. You may disable it for specific links with the `data-turbo-preload` attribute (if you need to):

    ```blade
    <a href="{{ route('posts.show', $post) }}" data-turbo-preload="false">
        {{ $post->title }}
    </a>
    ```
